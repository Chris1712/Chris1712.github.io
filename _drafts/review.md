I've been working with my current employer (Fidessa, now part of [ION Group](https://iongroup.com/)) for nine months now, and I think it's a good time to look back and reflect on what I've learned so far, and what I hope to achieve in the future.

In comparison with my previous positions, ION is a much larger organisation, but more importantly its focus is purely in software - and that really makes a huge difference. Here I have several levels of management above me who understand engineering principles and help shape the organisation to prioritise best practises, and it really pays off in terms of time available to invest in things like CI, where a less technical organisation might not appreciate the value of strong processes.

In particular, this shows with how strongly they embrace agile principles, and that's definitely one of the most valuable things I've picked up. My team has well-written stories and well-planned sprints, a responsive and present product owner, brisk standups, and real buy-in from everyone. And it's the last one that's the most important, by far - the organisational setup is good, but agile is about people over processes and having every developer in an agile mindset just makes everything work so well.

I mentioned the time we invest in our CI, and I've learned a lot there, too. Everything we build goes through jenkins, and it's well-integrated with our other tools. And again, everyone is involved in it and we all appreciate the value of keeping it working well, the shared responsibility is key to maintaining a smooth system. I've had opportunities to work on pipeline scripts and tooling as well as general administration and it's all been very valuable.

Still, now having been working here for nine months, I've been exposed to most of the technologies fairly thoroughly now, and as much as I'm a generalist at heart, I think now is the point when I can move back into focusing more tightly on the areas where I really want to develop in-depth knowledge.
